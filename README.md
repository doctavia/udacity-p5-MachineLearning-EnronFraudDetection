4th project of Data Analyst Nanodegree, Machine Learning - Enron Fraud Detection

In this project, machine learning algorithm will be deployed to identify fraud from Enron financial and email features, with the goal to minimise missed frauds and false alarms. Machine learning is useful in this project as it could detect unusual pattern in either financial and/or email datasets, which effectively can be used to uncover fraudulent as soon as it happens in the future.
